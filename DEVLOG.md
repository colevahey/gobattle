I need to work on declaring the global player variable and I need
a sleep package for when I change between functions.

#July 14th
I cannot find a good article on how to declare a global variable.
I changed the layout of the code so that it is running in one single
function. This does present problems when there is an unacceptable
input and the function must begin again. I did find the time.Sleep
package so I can give the player time to read the message as it
flashes on the screen.

I am having a good bit of trouble with converting integers to strings.
I will continue to work on it over the week so that I can get this
program up and running.

#July 25th
I have a successful game up and running **if** you pick the red team.
I am having some trouble with the division for the blue team because
of having to deal with floats. I am so excited that the red team is
working. I have to keep testing for bugs, and I hope that in the
future, I will be able to save the high score and average scores in
a json file which I can show at the end of the game.

#July 28th
I have just figured out how to use json in a go script so I think
I will be able to do a high score page at the end of the game. I need
to figure out how to structure the high score page and I believe
a problem will be posed because it is too easy to achieve the high
score. I would like to add a time component to the game so that even
with the high score, you can also compete with time.

#August 1st
The json is up and running although I realized that the data won't
save. I am very excited this is working and I will continue to get the
kinks out.

#August 2nd
While the json is working, I am still trying to get it to save the
high score unless it is beaten. I believe that if I can get the json
to marshal the new data and to just leave the old high score alone,
I can get it to work. I still haven't tried to do anything with the
floats because I think that will be a simple task when I have
completed the json. I am nearly done.

#August 8th
I have completed my project. I fixed the floats by getting rid of them
completely... I made it so that the division problem will always
return a whole number. Now my game is complete and if I have time,
I will try to work on a high score page to be displayed at the end of
the game. I am very excited I am done.
