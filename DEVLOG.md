I need to work on declaring the global player variable and I need
a sleep package for when I change between functions.

I cannot find a good article on how to declare a global variable.
I changed the layout of the code so that it is running in one single
function. This does present problems when there is an unacceptable
input and the function must begin again. I did find the time.Sleep
package so I can give the player time to read the message as it
flashes on the screen.

I am having a good bit of trouble with converting integers to strings.
I will continue to work on it over the week so that I can get this
program up and running.

I have a successful game up and running *if* you pick the red team.
I am having some trouble with the division for the blue team because
of having to deal with floats. I am so excited that the red team is
working. I have to keep testing for bugs, and I hope that in the
future, I will be able to save the high score and average scores in
a json file which I can show at the end of the game.
